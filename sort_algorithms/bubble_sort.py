"""
Comparison sort
- Works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted,
comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they
are in the wrong order. If we have a total of n elements, we need
to repeat the process (n-1) times. 
- Can be modified to stop early if it finds that the list has become sorted.
Therefore, instead of n(n-1) comparisons, we have n(n-1)/2 comparisons.
- Not practical when n is large.

Performance: Worst Case O(n2), Best Case O(n)
Memory: O(1)
